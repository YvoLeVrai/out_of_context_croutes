# Out of context Croute Twiter Bot

To have the project work properly you will want to create a .env file in your working directory, including your twitter api keys and a ENV var that tell if you're in DEV or PROD environment.

```
ENV=DEV

access_token=YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS-KEY
access_token_secret=YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN
consumer_key=YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
consumer_secret=YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_TOKEN
```
